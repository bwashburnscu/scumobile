            FAVL Burkina's strategy over the last two years has been to encourage local rural councils, and their elected mayors, to sign five year partnership agreements where we gradually turn over full responsibility for managing village libraries to the office of the mayor.&nbsp; Koura Donkoui and Sanou Dounko, our indefatigable national and regional coordinators, have been pursuing this goal diligently.&nbsp; <br /><br />Burkina Faso's second rural council elections (ever!) were held in December 2012 and the new crop of mayors (well, a lot were reelected) being sworn into office.&nbsp; The new mayor of Boni, in southwestern Burkina Faso, was happy to continue the cooperative partnership of the old mayor, and was happy to officially sign the partnership understanding.&nbsp; We're very pleased at the formalization of a good partnership!<br />
